# Samoyed Video Quiz
This is a simple web app I created out of my love for Samoyeds, an awesome dog breed!

The video is grabbed from Youtube, and quizzes people on Samoyeds while they watch the video about it.
User hits play on the video, it plays up to a certain point, pauses, and asks user a multiple choice question. If answered correctly, it congratulates the user and continues playing. If not, it gives user the choice of replaying that chunk of the video, or showing user the correct answer and continuing the video from that point. At the end of the video, it gives user their percentage score and gives them the option to retake the quiz.

**I worked with Youtube API for this project, and used vanilla CSS, FontAwesome, and Javascript, which is written in the HTML file.**
The app accepts a hard-coded JSON string that contains information about the quiz, including questions, choices, answers and the video URL.
